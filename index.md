#### Your child is invited to go camping with us!! 🏕 🌲 🌊
---

I am Patrick,  Trevor Ortell's father. This summer we are doing a co-ed chaperoned camping trip to Horsetooth reservoir (Lory state park side) from **June 13th-16th 2022**. We decided to do this locally so everyone would still have cell phone service and still be close to home. All food and accommodations will be taken care of. Below is the map of the campsite location we have reserved at the lake. FAQ and information on the itinerary, meals, and contact information is also below. 

Please RSVP by June 1st to 720-229-5528 or [patrick.ortell@arus.io](mailto:patrick.ortell@arus.io)

***What about bathrooms?*** 🚽 🪥 🚻 🧻

There are normal gender-separated bathroom facilities within a 5 min walk from camp (you can see them from camp)

  

***Is this co-ed?*** 👦 ⚡️ 👧

Yes, there will be 2 large tents, one for boys and one for girls (spaced ~300 ft from each other) and I will be monitoring this so things are kept PG-rated at all times. We understand some parents still might not be in a place wherein they feel comfortable with this and that's totally cool, we get it, your kiddos are still invited todo join via day trips.

  

***What if cell service is spotty?*** 📲 🔌

Depending on your cell provider your child might not get cell service down at the lake so I will be sending kiddos up to the bathrooms (it's on the hill and gets service) 4 times a day (morning, lunch, dinner, and after dark) and you can always call/text us directly on our cell phones 720-229-5528 or 970-852-3677.

  
  

***What about special diets?*** 🍔 🌮 🍎

We would like to accommodate everyone possible so in addition to standard options we will also have gluten-free and plant-based options at every meal if that's their jam. See the meals list below for what we are eating. If your child has a major food allergy please let us know so we can accommodate if we have advanced notice.

 
 ***Can parents swing by and hang out?*** 👋 🙋‍♀️ 🙋
 
 Yes of course, you will either need a Lory state park pass, or pay the $8 for park entry if you would like to come hang out durring park hours. See map above for location details. 


***Will you send us pics from the event?*** 📷 ⛺️

Yes!! If you would like copies of pics of the trip give us a few days after we get home to get them processed and we will add you to a google drive folder. Just send an email to [patrick.ortell@arus.io](mailto:patrick.ortell@arus.io) and I will make sure you are added to the private folder.
